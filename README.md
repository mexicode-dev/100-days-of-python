# 100 Days of Python

This repository documents my journey through a structured, project-based Python learning program focused on building real-world programming skills.

The goal of this challenge is not only to learn syntax, but to develop practical problem-solving abilities, clean coding habits and consistency through daily hands-on work.

## What this repository contains

- Daily Python exercises and mini projects  
- Automation scripts and utility tools  
- API integrations and data processing examples  
- Web scraping and basic backend experiments  
- Small web and GUI applications  
- Progressive improvement of Python fundamentals and OOP concepts  

## Learning focus

Throughout this challenge I am focusing on:

- Writing readable and maintainable Python code  
- Understanding core programming concepts and patterns  
- Building small but functional applications  
- Developing automation and scripting skills  
- Practicing real-world development workflows with Git and GitHub  

## Repository structure

Each day is organized in its own folder following this naming convention:

day01  
day02  
day03  
...  
day100  

Each folder contains the code and exercises completed for that day.

## Goal

The main objective of this repository is continuous improvement through consistent daily practice and building practical programming foundations that can be used in real-world projects.
